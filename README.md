# Efficient-Algoritms

The goal of this repository is to provide effective solutions to common problems using efficient algorithms!
The problems and solutions presented in this repository will help anyone develop a solid grasp on problem solving skills.

I'm taking these questions from leetcode.com, and learning the solutions with the help of [neetcode]([url](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)https://neetcode.io/roadmap)

### Directory and Filename convention

Directories should have all first letters capitalized e.g. HashMap, LinkedList, etc.
Files should be named after the problem they solve. Shortened names are fine if they make sense. Exchange spaces for _underscores. e.g. find_shortest_path.py
